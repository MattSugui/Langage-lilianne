# Lilian programming language

The Lilian programming language is a weird mix of Pascal, C# and Visual Basic/FoxPro with none of their innate features in the language itself. The language is technically .NET, however it does need weird methods to reference .NET classes. This is infact a layer ''above'' .NET.

The Coco preprocessing and scripting language that comes with this is based off of Visual Basic.
